                <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                    Iron Elephant offers instructional content—frameworks, case studies, scripts, templates, deal-analysis walkthroughs, and coaching—to help you understand real-estate wholesaling and related strategies. We do not:

                <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 mb-4 ml-4">
                    <li>Locate, broker, sell, buy, fund, or guarantee real estate deals;</li>
                    <li>Provide legal, tax, securities, financial-planning, or credit-repair services;</li>
                    <li>Act as your fiduciary, agent, or licensed real-estate professional.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-brand-navy mb-3">1.2 Not Professional Advice.</h3>
                <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                    All materials are general education. Before acting on any concept, you must consult your own licensed attorney, CPA, financial adviser, mortgage professional, or real-estate broker. Nothing herein creates an attorney-client, CPA-client, or brokerage relationship.
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-brand-navy mb-4">2. NO EARNINGS OR RESULTS GUARANTEE.</h2>
                
                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-brand-navy mb-3">2.1 No Promise of Profit.</h3>
                <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                    We make no representation—express or implied—that you will earn (a) any money, (b) your tuition back, or (c) a specific number of deals, leads, or commissions.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-brand-navy mb-3">2.2 Illustrative-Only Figures.</h3>
                <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                    Dollar amounts, profit margins, ROI examples, or "checks held up on camera" are illustrative and often represent exceptional results. You should assume most participants earn no income or incur a net loss.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-brand-navy mb-3">2.3 Forward-Looking Statements.</h3>
                <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                    Any reference to future earnings, growth, or market conditions constitutes a "forward-looking statement" under the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Such statements are based on assumptions that may prove inaccurate.
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-brand-navy mb-4">3. VARIABLES AFFECTING OUTCOMES (Beyond Our Control).</h2>

                    <li>Local real-estate inventory, interest-rate environment, and buyer demand.</li>
                    <li>Your credit, available capital, risk tolerance, negotiation skill, and sales ability.</li>
                    <li>Time you devote to marketing, due-diligence, lead follow-up, and compliance.</li>
                    <li>Unexpected events (zoning changes, title defects, litigation, economic downturns, pandemics, etc.).</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                    For these reasons you may earn nothing and could lose money.
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-brand-navy mb-4">4. TESTIMONIALS, CASE STUDIES, AND ENDORSEMENTS.</h2>
                
                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-brand-navy mb-3">4.1 Atypical Results.</h3>
                <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                    Testimonials spotlight individual experiences and are not statistically representative. Any testimonial implying rapid income, "quit-your-job" timelines, or minimal effort must be considered atypical.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-brand-navy mb-3">4.2 Incentivized or Affiliate Testimonials.</h3>
                <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                    Some endorsers may receive free access, discounted tuition, affiliate commissions, or other consideration. We advise you to weigh such endorsements accordingly.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-brand-navy mb-3">4.3 Request for Data.</h3>
                <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                    If we cite an earnings figure, you may request our Earnings Claim Statement. To request, email legal@ironelephant.co with subject line "ECS Request." The Company reserves the right to update or revise such policies as new data becomes available.
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-brand-navy mb-4">5. BUSINESS–OPPORTUNITY AND FTC COMPLIANCE.</h2>
                
                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-brand-navy mb-3">5.1 No Franchise or Biz-Opp Sale.</h3>
                <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                    We do not sell a license, territory, protected market, or turnkey business. The Programs are coursework, not a business package.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-brand-navy mb-3">5.2 Cooling-Off Rule.</h3>
                <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                    We comply with 16 CFR § 429 (Door-to-Door & Remote Sales Rule) when applicable. If law requires a 3-day cancellation window, we will honor it; however, our standard policy is "no cash refunds" (see Terms of Service).
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-brand-navy mb-4">6. FINANCING AND CREDIT RISK DISCLOSURE.</h2>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 mb-6 ml-4">
                    <li>Financing offered through third-party lenders is wholly independent of the Company.</li>
                    <li>We receive no kickback for your financing decision.</li>
                    <li>You bear all repayment risk. We do not warrant that you will generate revenue to service or repay debt.</li>
                    <li>You are solely responsible for evaluating and assuming any repayment obligations, including associated interest, fees, or late penalties.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-brand-navy mb-4">7. EXTERNAL COSTS AND TOOLS.</h2>
                <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                    Enrollment fees cover tuition, community access, and specified software trials only. You may incur additional expenses—including but not limited to: marketing campaigns, skip tracing, list-purchase fees, earnest money, closing costs, professional services, and travel. These costs are your responsibility and may exceed your initial tuition.
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-brand-navy mb-4">8. REGULATORY AND LICENSING COMPLIANCE.</h2>
                <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                    Certain states restrict or license real-estate wholesaling, marketing, cold-calling, or assignment-of-contract activities. You must verify and comply with:
                </p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 mb-4 ml-4">
                    <li>State real-estate statutes & brokerage laws.</li>
                    <li>Federal & state Do-Not-Call ("DNC") laws and the Telephone Consumer Protection Act ("TCPA").</li>
                    <li>CAN-SPAM, GDPR, CCPA, and any data-privacy rules applicable to your marketing.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                    We do not provide legal clearance. Failure to comply may expose you to fines or criminal liability.
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-brand-navy mb-4">9. RECORDING AND MONITORING NOTICE.</h2>
                <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                    Coaching calls, group sessions, webinars, and community channels may be recorded. By participating, you grant the Company an irrevocable worldwide license to record, photograph, edit, distribute, and display your likeness, voice, and contributions for training, quality control, or marketing, without compensation. If you do not consent, do not attend live sessions. If required by law, we will offer the ability to opt out of certain uses or request deletion of recordings that contain personally identifiable information.
